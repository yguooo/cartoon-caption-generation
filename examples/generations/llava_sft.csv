Try to come up with funny captions that fit the cartoon, but are not too direct. It may be funnier if the person reading the caption has to think a little bit to get the joke. Next, I will provide a cartoon image with descriptions and then you should generate 1 funny caption for the cartoon along with an explanation for each.
