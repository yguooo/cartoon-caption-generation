This caption plays off the idea that the caveman is cooking an enormous piece of meat, which could be seen as a sign of wealth or status. By suggesting that the caveman invited his in-laws specifically to show them his big game (i.e. the meat), the caption implies that the in-laws are also big game hunters, and that the caveman wants to impress them with his own hunting skills. The use of the word ""big"" in both ""game"" and ""in-laws"" creates a pun that adds humor to the caption.",The caveman's grilling skills must be legendary - even his choice of meat seems out of this world!,It's amazing how far we've come since our ancestors were stuck grilling over a tiny fire.
